# PointsBot

By [Erty](https://erty.me)

## Installation / Development

Download pointsbot using Git.

Run `python3 create_db.py` to create a new database file.

If you want, you can run `python3 create_db.py --drop` to optionally drop any existing database. (Don't run this in prod!)

You'll also need to create a file called `token` and put your Discord OAuth token in there as the only content.

## Running

Run the program with `python3 pointsbot.py`
